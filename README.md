# p6spy-checker
A small class to parse through some p6spy output and isolate the longest running queries

## What does it do?
Basically takes a p6spy output file (these can be extremely large and difficult to read) and parses it. It then does the following:
- isolates the n longest running queries (n is configurable)
- it then gets the actual queries being run for each long-running query and spits that out too.

## How to make it work
There are just a couple of things in the code you need to change.

java \-jar target/p6spy_stuff-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \-l "./spy36.log" \-b 11
* Options are l & b
        * \-l is the spy.log you want to analyze
        * \-b is the top number of long running operations you which to see.  (\â€“b 10 will show 10 longest running operations)

## Prerequisites
* Eclipse
* Java 7 or 8

## Output example:
```
3 of the longest query times:
2 - Processing
QueryTime (ms): 243
2 - Processing
QueryTime (ms): 208

## Note
The code for this checker looks for delimited patterns based on the 'logMessageFormat' found [here](https://p6spy.github.io/p6spy/2.0/configandusage.html)
